This is a little project I did to challenge myself after working through a few Python courses on Codecademy.com. I wanted, in particular, to see if I could recreate the classic minesweeper behavior in which selecting a “blank” tile (that is, one not adjacent to any mines) reveals all the connected blank tiles and the numbered tiles (those directly adjacent to one or more mines) that border them. I accomplished this by conceiving of the game board as a graph, with each square equivalent to a node in the graph. That way, each node could store data about whether it was a mine, whether it was revealed, and whether it was flagged, as well as a list of all adjacent nodes.
